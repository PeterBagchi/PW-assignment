        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime (e.g., Python), while compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution (e.g., C); compiled code usually runs faster and has a separate build step, whereas interpreted code is more portable and easier to test interactively.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: Exception handling in Python is the mechanism to catch and respond to runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks so the program can handle errors gracefully instead of crashing.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: The finally block always executes after try/except (whether an exception occurred or not) and is used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: Logging in Python is recording runtime information (messages, errors, warnings) to a configurable output (console, file, etc.) using the logging module to help with debugging and auditing.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be garbage-collected; it can be used for cleanup but its execution timing is not guaranteed and its use is generally discouraged.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: The difference: import module imports the whole module and requires module.name to access members; from module import name imports specific members into the current namespace so you can use them directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "   Answer: You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying multiple except blocks for different exception types, or using a single except tuple like except (TypeError, ValueError): to handle several exceptions together.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: The with statement (context manager) ensures resources like files are properly acquired and released; when the block exits it automatically closes the file even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer: Multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process sharing memory (good for I/O-bound tasks); multiprocessing uses separate processes with independent memory (better for CPU-bound tasks and true parallelism).\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Advantages of logging: persistent record of events, easier debugging, configurable verbosity, centralized error tracking, and safer than printing to stdout for production systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Answer: Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and freeing memory automatically for objects, primarily handled by reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Basic steps in exception handling: identify risky code, wrap in try block, catch exceptions in except blocks, optionally use else for non-error path, and use finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Memory management is important to avoid leaks, ensure efficient use of resources, maintain performance, and prevent crashes due to exhaustion of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Answer: try contains the code that may raise an exception; except catches and handles specific exceptions so the program can continue or exit gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Python’s garbage collection uses reference counting to immediately free objects with zero references and a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect reference cycles that reference counting alone can't free.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Answer: The else block runs if the try block completes without raising an exception; it’s useful for code that should run only when no exceptions occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Common logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: os.fork() creates a new child process by duplicating the current process (Unix only) and returns in both; multiprocessing module provides a cross-platform API to spawn processes and manage inter-process communication more safely and portably.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Closing a file flushes buffers and releases system resources; failing to close can lead to data loss, resource leaks, or hitting file descriptor limits.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: file.read() reads the entire file (or a specified number of bytes) into memory; file.readline() reads one line at a time—useful for processing large files line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: The logging module provides flexible facilities to log messages from Python programs, including handlers, formatters, and configurable log levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system—file and directory operations, checking file existence, permissions, and path manipulation—useful in file handling tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Challenges in memory management: memory leaks from lingering references, large data structures consuming RAM, fragmentation, and managing memory in long-running processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Raise an exception manually using the raise statement, e.g., raise ValueError('message') to signal an error condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer: Multithreading is important for applications that perform many I/O-bound operations (networking, disk I/O, UI responsiveness) because threads can run while one thread is waiting, improving throughput and responsiveness.\n",
